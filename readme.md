# sendgridform v0.1

A simple contact form using sendgrid's api, and protected with recaptcha (and a very simple verification method).

This was mangled together by [Gustavo Malamud] (http://www.malamud.com.ar) at [hola at gustavomalamud.com.ar](hola@gustavomalamud.com.ar).

## Requisites

This contact form only needs your web server to be able to run html, php (5.4+ on compatible as far as I know), and cURL. 

## Caveats / Possible trouble

### Rejection behaviors

As I haven't found a useful option to do away with pesky bots and verify rejections the default action will be for the rejected proposition to come back to the index.html.
Nevertheless you can kill off all rejected requests by either redirecting to another page of your choice or directly killing off all activity on the script.

To do so, please check your js folder, on the verify.php file and check the section of the code we mark below:

```
  else
        {
         	header("Location: ../index.html");
        }

```
### Necessary fields for recaptcha

Please check that both your public and private recaptcha keys are in place. 

The public key is located in the * index.html * file, right before the send button, as shown right here:

```

<!-- WARNING! -->
<!-- PLEASE ENTER YOUR PUBLIC KEY HERE: If you haven't got one, sign up and get your keys at https://www.google.com/recaptcha/admin#list -->

<div class="g-recaptcha" data-sitekey="INSERT YOUR PUBLIC KEY HERE" style="padding-bottom:30px;"></div>

<input class="input-btn animated wow flipInY delay-08s send" type="submit" value="Send"> <!-- Send button-->

```

Whilst your private key can be found at * verify.php *, within:  

```
 //verify captcha
        $recaptcha_secret = "enter your private key here";

```

### Necessary fields for SendGrid

Please do not forget to enter the information for your sendgrid account on the * sender.php * file, right in 

```

<?php
// use actual sendgrid username and password in this section
$url = 'https://api.sendgrid.com/'; 
$user = 'sendgrid user'; // place SG username here
$pass = 'sendgrid password'; // place SG password here


```

Should you have any doubts about this form, please do visit their [demo form] (https://sendgrid.com/blog/create-basic-contact-form-sendgrid-php/) which I pretty much used for my own purposes. 



## To Do List

~~- Add text verification (Maybe happy.js?)~~
- Concatenate php files into one
- Find a better solution to the non-validated form

## Apologies

To the purists of PHP, 

To the sorcerors of clean css, 

To the builders of truly good code, 

To the craftsmen of software...

As this is my first repo and collaboration ever for, surprisingly, something that I haven't yet seen posted anywhere.

## Thanks

To the good friends at [Sendgrid] (http://www.sendgrid.com) for their [demo] (https://sendgrid.com/blog/create-basic-contact-form-sendgrid-php/) on how to build the form.

To all of you having to read this unfinishable dross of code and poor text. 

And to all of you that wish to take this beyond my abilities.
